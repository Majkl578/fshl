About FSHL
--------------------------------

	FSHL is a free, open source universal syntax highlighter written
	in PHP. Very fast FSHL parser performs syntax highlighting for few
	languages (HTML with embeded PHP and CSS, PHP, CSS, JAVA, CPP, PYTHON)
	and produces XHTML output.

	FSHL library is just only syntax highlighter. Its API provides only
	few methods, which are really need to highlight sources.
	FSHL does not support any form of results caching. I think that
	this is job for your CMS, which can do this better than FSHL.

	FSHL core is very flexible and when you want add any new
	languages, send any suggestions to me.


Installation and usage notes
--------------------------------

	Basic installation is very easy:

	1. Copy entire sub-directory 'fshl' into your project

	2. Choose the best output module for your project, or make your own

	   There are some deafult output modules in 'fshl/out' directory:

		 HTML         - is default output module and produces XHTML output.
						Results must be manually embeded to <pre> tag.

		 HTML_HP      - like HTML module, but adds links to help pages on
						defined keywords.

	3. Create your best adapter between FSHL and your project

	   FSHL is only highlighter, simple and fast :)
	   If you want superb API try another one.


	4. Create your own nice CSS stylesheet, or use existing one.

	   You must link CSS manually in your HTML templates, FSHL never
	   builds any stylesheets.


Stylesheet example
--------------------------------

	Nice default stylesheet is located in the 'fshl/styles/COHEN_style.css' file.
	NOTE: You may copy this file into better location in your project.
